# Super Resolution using Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)

This is an implementation of the SRGAN model proposed in the paper
[Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)
with TensorFlow.

# Requirements

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV 3

# Usage

I. Pre-train the VGG-19 model.

II. Train SRGAN (SR ResNet + VGG + Discriminator) model.
